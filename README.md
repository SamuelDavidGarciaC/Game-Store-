What is the content of this platform and what does each tab work for?

- Mockup: <br>
The first thing we did was to make a mockup of our website to have a clear and organized idea of the steps to follow to build the page respecting the standards already proposed

- Home: <br>
It is the main screen that we will find when entering our platform. Maintaining an intuitive design we will be able to know what other tabs are on the page (navigation bar) and what it is about in a short summary

- Products: <br>
In this section of products we decided to place the new video games at the top, at the bottom we place the 5 most representative games of each platform and a button to see more that directs the user to the category tab

- Categories: <br>
It is the section in which we can find 15 video games each with their name, price and discount. These are divided into 3 main categories (ACTION, TERROR AND ADVENTURE)

- Description Game: <br>
in this tab we place the image of the game with a quick description, next to the rating of the users that is the MetaScore with other subgenres and buttons that redirect them to the general description and technical requirements so that the game can run correctly on the PC platform since on Xbox and PlayStation there is no need for this option because the developers already have optimized the games they launch by default.<br>

We also add a trailer to the games along with 5 representative images of these, and on the right side it is indicated that the product has a warranty, is in stock, is digital and shows the final price with the discount, also the shopping cart

- Support: <br>
In the support section we can see a large contact form maintaining that intuitive and minimalist design in which we will have the possibility of sending an email to the administrators in case we have any problem with the page or with our purchase

- Your Cart: <br>
Aquí están los videojuegos seleccionados ya listos para el proceso de compra, como herramienta de marketing también agregamos a continuación una sección para descubrir videojuegos en caso de que al usuario le apetezca jajaja,

- Billing: <br>
This last section of the page finally allows the user to pay for the video game that he has decided to buy. It is divided into 3 sections. The main data at the top. The payment methods in the lower section, such as plastic money, the paypal platform, nequi through our telephone number and through WhatsApp. Finally in the right section there is a brief description of the purchase. The image of the video game next to its name. The chosen platform and the total value of the purchase
